# The Escher Project


Completing Escher's Print Gallery using Machine Learning
=======
The project aims to use Machine Learning techniques to complete the painting in an accurate way.

The challenges of the project are:

  1. The painting presents a "Droste effect" where a picture contains smaller versions of the same picture embedded. Like a "Matrioshka" effect.
  
  2. The painting embeds a spiral-like pattern that creates a sense of infinite loop to the viewer. This is a conformal mapping.
