Our strategy: allow for more general learning
The idea is to have a method that will be superior from the ones from the mathematicians in 2 aspects:

  •	Functional form - > It will allow for a more general family of functions (i.e. it will learn the best function from a given family)

  •	Coefficients - > It will allow for a more general parameters of the functions. 

Both premises above will hopefully allow us to fit Escher’s lithography in a more exact way. For now, we won’t be able to detach completely (or be superior) than the conformal mapping proposed by the mathematicianswe, however will be able to learn a more general conformal mapping and ideally… more tailored to the imperfections of the painting.

So I will start from the conformal mapping, in the sense that we still want a function that preserve angles, and I will propose some learning strategies, to give as much freedom to our algo as possible. While still being able to learn. 

**Since GitHub doesn's support formulas on their Markdown, I have placed all the approaches in the Word document**
